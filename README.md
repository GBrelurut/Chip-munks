# Chip-munks
A Chip-seq framework based on the most frequently used tools and workflows

## Introduction

Chip-seq emerged as a useful tool for the study of epigenetic regulation (Lopez et al., 2017, Edward et al., 2017). Growing interest in the technic lead to developpment of a large amount of tools. Considering the variety of approaches, there is a need for a flexible and documented framework. With Chip-munks we propose such a framework, based on out of date knowledge in this field.
